# hello-world
I'm using Jupyter Notebook, and I've downloaded Anaconda specifically for that purpose. I'm wondering if GitHub has a good way to save python programs, since I can use branches to edit files before committing to changes in the main file. This seems like a good solution to the problem that I sometimes have when I make changes to a program but realize that it worked better in the previous iteration. For now, the two (GitHub and Jupyter Notebook) will remain separate. But I will continue to access GitHub and play with its functions to explore this possibility further.
